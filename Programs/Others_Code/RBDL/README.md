# RBRL
This repository implements the RBRL method, proposed in our following paper:  
Guoqiang Wu, Ruobing Zheng, Yingjie Tian and Dalian Liu. Joint Ranking SVM and Binary Relevance with Robust Low-Rank Learning for Multi-Label Classification. Neural Networks, 2020, 122: 24-39.
## Run
run the demo.m in MATLAB, RBRL will run as its default parameters on sample datasets.
